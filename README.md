## AI for business 

Welcome to our project for the course Artificial Intelligence for Business where we apply machine learning models to a funda dataset of one of the previous courses.

We have build and evaluated machine learning approaches to predict the price of a house,  and the time to sell a house.





### EDA Folder

In here you will find the exploratory data analysis and feature extraction. At the end of each notebook a new csv file is created containing the relevant features that need to be used in the modelling notebook





### Modelling folder

This folder contains a random forest model and Neural Network model. They are trained to predict the selling price and time to sell.





### Conclusion folder

The results of the two models are analyzed and the best model is chosen
